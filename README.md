Hi, I am a 14 Year old dev interested in all things low level with C and C++. I am oblicated to tell you that I use Arch btw. and am active on X under the same name as my gh.  
My favourite projects:
- Tetris (WIP)
- encoder decoder (very simple but from a time where I still was learning C++)
- CPU emulator (really fun project)
- Rayphys (Raylib is fun to work with and I love C limiting me)
